Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Georgie Lillington, this website presents my work and showcase my skills as a front-end developer. This website serves as a window into my journey in web design, coding, and everything I'm passionate about.

Built with Bootstrap
I've crafted this portfolio using the Bootstrap framework which has enabled me to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for visitors, it is responsive on all screen sizes - particularly mobile and makes use of hover and box-shadow.
